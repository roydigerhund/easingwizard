## üé® Examples

### Spring Animation 

```css
.spring-curve {
  transition-timing-function: linear(0, 0.053 0.8%, 0.197 1.6%, 1.267 5.5%, 1.432 6.6%, 1.484 7.6%, 1.463 8.4%, 1.386 9.3%, 0.868 13.2%, 0.794 14.2%, 0.766 15.2%, 0.774 16%, 0.809 16.9%, 1.065 20.9%, 1.1 21.9%, 1.113 22.9%, 1.109 23.7%, 1.092 24.6%, 0.968 28.6%, 0.945 30.5%, 0.956 32.3%, 1.016 36.3%, 1.027 38.2%, 0.987 45.9%, 1.006 53.5%, 0.997 61.2%, 1);
}
```

**Tailwind CSS:**

```css
ease-[linear(0,0.053_0.8%,0.197_1.6%,1.267_5.5%,1.432_6.6%,1.484_7.6%,1.463_8.4%,1.386_9.3%,0.868_13.2%,0.794_14.2%,0.766_15.2%,0.774_16%,0.809_16.9%,1.065_20.9%,1.1_21.9%,1.113_22.9%,1.109_23.7%,1.092_24.6%,0.968_28.6%,0.945_30.5%,0.956_32.3%,1.016_36.3%,1.027_38.2%,0.987_45.9%,1.006_53.5%,0.997_61.2%,1)]
